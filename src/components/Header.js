        <p>
          Welcome to my Mass Effect Codex project! Here youâ€™ll find codex entries from all three
          Mass Effect games (minus the entries from the DLCs).
        </p>
        <p>
          All codex entries are placed into one of two categories: Primary and Secondary.
          **Primary** entries consists of blank subcategories that define different areas of
          interest that are key to the storyline of Mass Effect. **Secondary** entries consist of
          blank subcategories that dive deeper into areas that are defined in the Primary entries.
