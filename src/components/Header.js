      <p>
        Welcome to the (unofficial) Mass Effect Codex. Here youâ€™ll find codex entries from all three
        Mass Effect games (minus the entries from the DLCs).
      </p>
      <p>
        All codex entries are placed into one of two categories: <span>Primary</span> and{" "}
        <span>Secondary</span>. Primary entries define different areas of interest that are key to
        the storyline of Mass Effect. Secondary entries dive deeper into areas that are defined in
        the Primary entries.
