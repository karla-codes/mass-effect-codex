# Mass Effect Codex

The Mass Effect Codex lets you view every codex entry from the Mass Effect video game series (minus the DLC). Every entry is divided into one of fifteen subjects and categorized as either Primary or Secondary. You can sort all entries by Category or Subject in addition to viewing them all in alphabetical order. All data is pulled from the [Mass Effect Codex API](https://github.com/karla-codes/mass-effect-api) I created along with this web app.

## Motivation

I'm a big fan of the Mass Effect video games and during my last playthrough, I realized that I'd only ever read a handful of the 200+ codex entries. My desire to finally read all of the codex entries grew and with that came the idea of creating a codex that I could view outside of the games.

I found a [website](https://n7hq.masseffect.com/codex/) EA had built that mimicked the the layout of the codex in game. I noticed that the desktop version was not responsive and lacked important accessibility features, like the ability to use the tab key to navigate through the site. So I decided to build a simple codex with the following goals in mind:

1. Prioritize accessibility
2. Make it responsive and mobile friendly
3. Create a simple design with a Mass Effect aesthetic
4. Use tech that I'm curious about/want to improve on

## Tech Stack

- React (Create React App)
- Sass
- Netlify
